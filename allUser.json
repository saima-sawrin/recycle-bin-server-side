        "description": "At-home waxing can be an affordable method for hair removal, but it’s important to take precautions. Never wax sunburned or very sensitive skin, and don’t wax if you have taken isotretinoin in the last six months. It may also be a good idea to leave Brazilian waxes to the professionals, since the skin in that area is particularly delicate.For the best technique and results, dermatologists recommend the following tips:Ensure optimal hair length. Before waxing, make sure your hair is about one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch long. If hair is longer, trim it to a shorter length using safety scissors so that waxing will be less messy and painful.Avoid retinoid creams before waxing. Avoid using over-the-counter skin care products containing retinol and prescription retinoids two to five days prior to waxing your face to avoid removing skin along with your hair.Reduce discomfort. Since waxing can be painful for some people, consider ways to reduce discomfort. Taking over-the-counter pain medication, such as ibuprofen, or applying cold packs to the skin about 30 minutes before waxing, may help."
